# [[Warden]] · F216 — Agent-state model — sensing what the agent is doing

## Summary

Rules can sense the **agent itself** via the `agent` object in the interpretation environment ([[Warden Semantics]] § The interpretation environment) — `agent.state` (`working` / `landed` / `asking` / `idle`), `agent.skill`, `agent.is_asking`. This lets a rule fire at a turn boundary (`when:: prompt:stop`) and react to *how the turn ended* — e.g. "you're ending the turn with an open question; record it in `queries.md`." F216 designs **how that state is actually determined**, which is non-trivial: it requires reasoning about the agent's recent activity, not reading a single flag.

## Success Criteria

**Tier:** 1 (design) — powers `agent.*` in the environment; rules that read it can't ship until this does.
**Blocks next:** [[F217 — Conversation-content gating — rules on what was said|F217]] (which extends observation from *state* to *transcript content*).

**What done looks like.** Given a live agent session, the daemon can answer `agent.state` accurately for the common cases: actively working (a task/skill in flight), landed (a clean turn end), asking (a pending user question, e.g. `/query` ran or `{NAME} queries.md` has open items), idle. `agent.skill` reports the running skill. The classifier is lazy + cached per pass (one read, shared across rules).

**How it will be verified.** Scripted scenarios that drive an agent into each state (mid-task, post-`/land`, post-`/query`, idle), asserting `agent.state` matches; a fixture rule (`R-ex-10`) fires its `tell` only in the `asking` state.

## Design

### The states — a closed set of five

`agent.state` is one of **five strings** — the four live states plus the honest error value. The set is **closed**: a rule can exhaustively match on it, and a read **never raises** — when no signal rung can answer confidently, the value is `unknown`.

| State | Meaning | Entered on | Left on |
|---|---|---|---|
| `working` | the agent holds control — a turn is in flight (model thinking, tool calls, a skill mid-run) | `prompt:submit`, or any tool/skill moment after the last turn end | a turn boundary, or liveness failure |
| `asking` | control is with the user **and** a question this session raised is pending on them | `prompt:stop` with the pending-question predicate **true** | the user replies (`prompt:submit` → `working`), or the pending items resolve |
| `landed` | control is with the user, nothing pending — the turn ended clean | `prompt:stop` with the predicate **false** | next `prompt:submit`, or quiet ≥ `T_idle` → `idle` |
| `idle` | no live activity — a long-quiet clean end, or the session is over | `landed` + quiet ≥ `T_idle`; `session:stop`; process gone | next `prompt:submit` / `session:start` |
| `unknown` | the bound session can't be classified at the available signal rung | fallback rung R4, or a liveness ambiguity (§ Debounce) | a better signal arriving |

**Transition semantics** (the asymmetries are the design):

- **Entering `working` is instant** — one `prompt:submit` or one tool moment flips it; there is no debounce on the way in.
- **Leaving `working` requires a boundary, never silence.** A long `Bash` call or a long model think emits no moments for minutes; mid-turn quiet is still `working`. Only `prompt:stop`, `session:stop`, or a liveness failure ends it.
- **`asking` is sticky.** A pending question does not decay on a timer — an unanswered question at hour three is exactly as pending as at minute one. It clears when the user answers or the pending items resolve (the predicate re-evaluates lazily at the next read).
- **`landed` decays to `idle`** after a quiet window `T_idle` (default **10 min**, an engine-config constant — not per-rule surface). `landed` is the *instantaneous* "just ended clean"; `idle` is the *durable* "nothing happening."
- **Session end is `idle`.** `agent.*` describes a *running* agent; a rule that cares about a dead session's leftover queue reads `anchor.doc("{NAME} queries.md")` directly (open fork: § Open Questions Q2).
- `agent.is_asking` is sugar for `agent.state == 'asking'`, unchanged from [[Warden Semantics]].

### The signal inventory

What the daemon can actually observe, per environment. Ordered by trust.

| Signal | What it carries | Trust | Latency | Available when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Moment ledger** — the daemon's own event stream | every hook moment ([[Warden Events]]): `prompt:submit/stop`, `tool:pre/post`, `skill:pre/post`, `session:*`, each timestamped per session | exact — structured events from the source | none — current up to the triggering event | hooks wired for the session (always true at live rule-fire time) |
| **Transcript JSONL** — `transcript_path` from the hook payload | the structured message stream: the last agent message, Skill/Task invocations, turn boundaries | high — Claude Code's own record | flush lag (sub-second to seconds) | any Claude Code session the daemon can map |
| **tmux pane** — `capture-pane` + pane title | the *rendered* state: input prompt idle vs busy, the running command, the last output, a **permission dialog pending** (which reaches neither hooks nor transcript) | medium — text of a render, parsed heuristically | ~instant | the session runs in tmux and the pane id is registered |
| **`{NAME} queries.md`** | the durable pending-question queue for the cwd anchor — mechanically parseable sections | high for *queue* state; blind to chat-only questions | file-fresh | the anchor exists (vault-wide convention) |
| **Process table** | is the session's `claude` process alive | exact, but liveness only | ~instant | always |
| **mtimes** — transcript file recency | coarse "something is happening" | low — activity, not meaning | write-flush | always |

**The session registry** is the plumbing under all of this: every hook payload carries `session_id`, `transcript_path`, and `cwd`, and the notifier forwards `$TMUX_PANE` from its inherited environment when present — so the daemon accumulates a per-session record `(session_id → transcript_path, cwd, pane_id, pid)` for free, from the first moment it sees. The **moment ledger** is a bounded in-memory ring per session (moments + timestamps); on daemon restart it is rebuilt from the transcript tail, so a restart costs recency of the ring, not correctness of the answer.

### The classifier — signals → state

Fully **mechanical — no LLM at any rung** (resolving prior open question 3): the four states are decidable from events and cheap text checks. Judgment-grade reading of *what was said* is [[F217 — Conversation-content gating — rules on what was said|F217]]'s `ask_oracle`, deliberately out of scope here. Evaluation order, on first `agent.*` read of a pass:

```
1. liveness   — session process gone, or session:stop seen        → idle
2. in flight  — ledger shows prompt:submit (or any tool/skill
                moment) after the last prompt:stop                → working
3. turn end   — last boundary is prompt:stop
                → pending-question predicate Q true               → asking
                → Q false                                         → landed
4. decay      — landed and no moment for ≥ T_idle                 → idle
```

**The pending-question predicate Q** — true if any of three tests holds, checked cheapest-first:

- **T1 — skill signal.** An asking-class skill (`query`; registry-extensible) ran this turn: a `skill:post:query` moment in the ledger. Exact when skill moments are emitted (dependency below).
- **T2 — queue signal.** `{NAME} queries.md` of the cwd anchor carries open items **that this session touched** — the ledger saw a `write:markdown` to that file this session, and its question sections are non-empty now. *Session-scoping is a deliberate narrowing of the Summary's "carries open items":* vault practice parks long-lived queries in every active anchor, so an unscoped Q2 would pin nearly every agent permanently to `asking` and make `landed` unreachable. (Open fork: § Open Questions Q1.)
- **T3 — chat-question heuristic.** The turn's final agent message addresses a question to the user: last non-code paragraph ends in `?`, or carries an options pattern (`(A)`/`(B)`, `Q<n>:`). Read from the transcript's last assistant record. Explicitly a **mechanical heuristic** — occasional misses on rhetorical questions are accepted; a rule needing judgment-grade detection layers F217 on top.

**Debounce / hysteresis** — restated as the invariants an implementation must hold:

- No debounce into `working`; no silence-based exit from `working` (long tool calls and long thinks are quiet and normal).
- One timer, `T_idle`, on the `landed → idle` edge only. `asking` carries no timer.
- **Crash ambiguity is `unknown`, not a guess.** Process alive, no `Stop`, ledger and transcript both quiet past `T_dead` (default **30 min**): a very long tool call and a hung agent are indistinguishable, so the classifier says `unknown` rather than fabricating `working` or `idle`. Process *dead* without a `Stop` is unambiguous → `idle`.
- Subagent moments (a `Task` fan-out) attribute to the **top-level session**; `agent` always describes the session the user is talking to, never a subagent.

**`agent.skill`** — the running skill, derived by rank:

1. **Skill moments** — a `skill:pre`/`skill:post` pair in the ledger maintains a stack; `agent.skill` is the innermost active skill's kebab name, `None` when the stack is empty. *Named dependency:* this rung waits on [[F209 — Unified trigger taxonomy + when language|F209]]'s open question — the `skill:pre/post` emission point (skills are runbooks, not processes). Until the skill-dispatch layer emits those moments, rank 1 is empty and rank 2 carries the answer — the design degrades, it does not block on M0.
2. **Transcript sniff** — the Skill-tool invocation (or `<command-name>` tag) in the current turn's records.
3. **Pane sniff** — the `/skill` command line visible at the last user prompt in scrollback.

Value contract: a kebab skill-name string, or `None` (no skill running, *or* not derivable at the current rung — a rule that must distinguish those reads `agent.state == 'unknown'` first).

**Laziness + cost.** One classification per pass, computed on the first `agent.*` read and shared by every rule in the pass ([[Warden Runtime]] § Indexed evaluation). The work is dict lookups over the ledger, at most one transcript-tail read, and one `queries.md` parse — well inside the audit budget and cheap enough for a `prompt:stop` steer.

### The fallback ladder

Each rung names what it can answer exactly and what degrades. The classifier binds a session, takes the **highest rung available** for it, and answers from there.

| Rung | Signals | Exact | Degraded |
|---|---|---|---|
| **R1 — in-band** (live rule fire: hook event + ledger + transcript) | all of § Signal inventory | everything — full-fidelity states, Q1–Q3, ranked `agent.skill` | nothing. Every *live* `agent.*` read is R1 by construction — a live rule runs inside a hook, so the ledger is current up to that very event |
| **R2 — tmux-registered** (out-of-band read — an audit pass, or observing a registered sibling session) | pane + transcript + queries.md + process table | `working`/`idle` from the rendered prompt state; permission-dialog stalls **visible** (uniquely at this rung) | boundary timing is render-grade, not event-grade; `agent.skill` from sniff (ranks 2–3); Q1 unavailable |
| **R3 — transcript-mapped** (no tmux; session's JSONL known) | transcript + queries.md + process table + mtime | `asking`/`landed` from the last assistant record + Q2/Q3; `idle` from stale mtime | `working` inferred from mtime freshness (latency = flush lag); a permission-dialog stall reads as `working`; skill from sniff |
| **R4 — residual** (no per-session mapping at all) | queries.md + process table | queue-state `asking` (coarse, anchor-scoped only); alive/dead | every turn-boundary state → `unknown`; `agent.skill` → `None`. This rung is the honest floor: turn-grade states need a per-session signal, and R4 says so rather than guessing |

This resolves prior open question 1 (how much to lean on tmux): the pane is **one rung, not the foundation** — the moment ledger and transcript outrank it for structure, and the pane's unique contribution is the rendered view (permission dialogs, control-with-user) plus coverage of sessions observed from outside.

### The environment contract

What a rule actually gets at fire time:

- **Binding.** Live path: `agent` binds to the session that produced the triggering moment. Audit path: to the session running the audit. Headless batch audit with no session: every read returns the error values (`state == 'unknown'`, `skill is None`, `is_asking is False`).
- **Values.** `agent.state` ∈ `{'working','landed','asking','idle','unknown'}` (closed); `agent.skill` is `str | None`; `agent.is_asking` is `bool`. Reads never raise — `unknown` / `None` **are** the error channel.
- **Freshness.** R1: exact as of the triggering event. R2/R3: staleness bounded by transcript flush lag (seconds) plus the pass's own runtime. R4 carries no freshness bound — which is precisely why its turn-grade answer is `unknown`.
- **Per-pass cache.** One classification per pass; all rules in the pass see the same answer. A later moment in the same turn opens a new pass and re-classifies.
- **Cost.** Mechanical at every rung; `agent.state` never spends LLM tokens (resolving prior open question 3 in the contract itself).

## Resolved

- **tmux dependency (prior Q1)** — the pane is rung R2 of a four-rung ladder, not the primary source; the daemon's own moment ledger + the transcript outrank it, and R4 names the honest floor. § The fallback ladder.
- **`agent.skill` emission (prior Q2)** — ranked derivation: skill moments when the skill-runner emits them (named F209 dependency), transcript sniff until then, pane sniff last. § The classifier.
- **Classifier cost (prior Q3)** — fully mechanical, no LLM at any rung; one lazy classification per pass. Judgment-grade content reading is F217's job.

## Open Questions

### Q1 — Q2-signal scope: which `queries.md` items make the agent `asking`? ^F216-Q1

The classifier's queue-signal test (pending-question predicate, § The classifier).

- **(A)** Session-scoped — only open items this session touched count; parked long-lived queries don't pin the state.
- **(B)** Anchor-scoped — any open item in the anchor's `queries.md` ⇒ `asking`, as the Summary's original wording reads.
- **Recommendation:** Lean (A) — under (B), `landed` is unreachable on any anchor with a standing queue (most active anchors); the state stops discriminating.

### Q2 — Does `asking` survive session end? ^F216-Q2

- **(A)** Ends with the session — a dead session is `idle`; the leftover queue stays visible to rules via `anchor.doc("{NAME} queries.md")`.
- **(B)** Persists — unanswered session-raised queries keep `agent.state == 'asking'` after the process exits, so a turn-boundary rule elsewhere can still see it.
- **Recommendation:** Lean (A) — `agent` describes a running agent; cross-session queue pressure is anchor state, already reachable through `anchor.*`.

## Status

**Designed 2026-07-01** — taxonomy (closed five-state set + transition semantics), signal inventory, mechanical classifier (pending-question predicate, debounce invariants, ranked `agent.skill`), four-rung fallback ladder, and the environment contract are concrete. Two forks filed (§ Open Questions). Not built — the classifier implements inside M2's environment build ([[F212 — Python reference implementation|F212]]); the scripted state fixtures land with [[F214 — Rule-system testing regime|F214]]. One named external dependency: rank-1 `agent.skill` waits on F209's `skill:pre/post` emission point (degrades to transcript sniff meanwhile, does not block).
